- Create a server
- In a 1v1 game, both players connect to the server 
- The game will only start when there are two players connected to the game
- If one player leaves and the connection breaks, the other player automatically wins (game over criteria)
- Each player will send their moves to the server, which will update the board and send the updated state to both players
